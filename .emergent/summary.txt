The previous AI engineer was tasked with diagnosing and fixing a critical issue in an existing full-stack application (React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB). The core problem was that the AI agent, despite generating task plans, would get stuck on step 1 in the UI and not deliver results, giving the impression that the LLM wasn't genuinely working.

The AI engineer systematically analyzed the backend and frontend code, starting from the reported symptom. Initial investigation revealed that the frontend was relying on HTTP polling to an absent backend endpoint (), causing the UI to never update. Additionally, the step execution logic in the backend was not properly updating the task status in the database, and there was a duplicate blueprint registration causing backend crashes.

After implementing fixes for these issues (creating the missing endpoint, correcting status updates, and removing duplicate blueprint registration), the agent *appeared* to complete steps quickly. The user then clarified that the steps were progressing too fast, indicating a fake execution, not actual LLM work. The engineer discovered  calls and a simulation fallback in the backend, which were causing the rapid, artificial progression. These were removed to ensure real LLM tool execution.

Finally, while the LLM was confirmed to be generating real content and files (checked via ANALISIS_COMPLETO_FINAL.md

The engineer followed a logical debugging path, moving from observed UI behavior to backend logic, then to actual LLM execution, and back to UI display.

<product_requirements>
The primary user requirement was to fix an existing full-stack application where an AI agent's task execution was failing. Specifically, the agent would generate task steps but get stuck on step 1 in the UI, failing to show progress or deliver final results. The user explicitly stated that the issue was not a lack of plan generation, but a failure in execution and result delivery, leading to a perception that the LLM was not genuinely working.

Initially, the problem manifested as:
1.  Agent plans generated, but UI stuck at step 1.
2.  No progress displayed in the UI.
3.  No final results delivered.

After initial fixes, a new problem emerged:
1.  Steps completed too quickly, seemingly fake or automatic, without real LLM processing.
2.  No real output from LLM displayed in the UI.

The latest requirement is to display the actual results generated by the LLM in the frontend, as the LLM has been confirmed to be generating real content and files in the backend. The core need is for the application to genuinely execute tasks, display real-time progress, and present the final, LLM-generated outputs to the user.

-   **Full-stack Architecture:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **Inter-service Communication:** HTTP polling (initially problematic), WebSockets (intended, but not fully utilized for progress), REST APIs.
-   **Task Execution Flow:** Agent generates steps, backend executes steps via a  and  (LLM), updates status, and emits events.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack structure:


-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary:** Main FastAPI application entry point. Handles API routing and blueprint registration.
    -   **Changes Made:**
        -   Fixed a critical bug where the  blueprint was being registered multiple times, causing backend crashes. The duplicate registration was removed to ensure the backend starts correctly and routes are properly handled. This resolved the  error during  testing.

-   **/app/backend/src/routes/agent_routes.py**:
    -   **Summary:** Contains FastAPI routes related to agent task management, including task execution, step processing, and status updates. This is central to how the agent's work progresses.
    -   **Changes Made:**
        -   **Added  endpoint:** This new endpoint was created to allow the frontend to poll for real-time task status updates. It returns , , or  states.
        -   **Fixed :** Modified to ensure that task steps are correctly updated in the MongoDB database from  to  to . This was crucial for the frontend to receive and display actual progress.
        -   **Removed  calls:** All artificial  calls (e.g., at lines 4696, 4962, 5173 as per analysis) were removed. These were causing the fake rapid completion of steps, preventing actual LLM execution. This ensures that steps only complete when the underlying LLM operations are finished.
        -   **Enhanced Logging:** Added more aggressive logging to  (around line 4930) to better diagnose if tools were truly executing or if silent exceptions were occurring, especially concerning the  availability.

-   **/app/backend/src/websocket/websocket_manager.py**:
    -   **Summary:** Manages WebSocket connections for real-time communication. While the frontend was found to be using HTTP polling, this file exists for potential WebSocket-based communication.
    -   **Changes Made:** No direct code changes were made to this file during the debugging process, but its existence was noted.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/TerminalView/TerminalView.tsx**:
    -   **Summary:** Frontend React component responsible for displaying the task execution progress, steps, and potentially output. This is the UI where the user observes the agent's activity.
    -   **Changes Made:** No direct code changes were made to this file. The issues identified here were related to its reliance on a missing backend endpoint and the lack of real-time data flow.

-   **/app/frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts**:
    -   **Summary:** A React hook for managing WebSocket connections on the frontend.
    -   **Changes Made:** No direct code changes were made to this file. It was noted that despite the presence of WebSocket logic, the frontend was still primarily using HTTP polling for task status updates.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Currently, there are no explicitly listed pending tasks that were discussed and not addressed. All identified issues (missing endpoint, status update, duplicate blueprint, artificial sleeps) have been addressed.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The application is currently in a state where the AI agent is genuinely executing tasks using the LLM and generating real content, storing it in the  directory. The previous issues of the agent getting stuck at step 1, or progressing artificially fast, have been resolved.

Specifically:
-   The missing backend endpoint  has been implemented, allowing the frontend to poll for task status.
-   The backend now correctly updates the status of each step in the database as it progresses ( ->  -> ).
-   All artificial  calls and simulation fallbacks in the backend's step execution logic have been removed, ensuring that step completion is tied to actual LLM tool execution.
-   A duplicated blueprint registration in  was identified and removed, resolving backend startup crashes.
-   Crucially, it has been verified by inspecting generated files (e.g., ) that the LLM is indeed generating detailed and meaningful content (e.g., analysis of AI tools).

The immediate and primary remaining issue is that while the LLM is working and generating results, these results and the real-time activity of the agent are **not being displayed in the frontend UI**. The frontend shows Esperando datos del agente... despite the backend correctly processing and completing tasks. The work was paused just as the AI engineer was about to investigate and fix the visualization of these generated results and real-time updates in the UI.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to arreglar la visualizaci√≥n de resultados en el frontend para que puedas VER lo que el agente est√° generando. This involves verifying file endpoints and displaying generated content.
