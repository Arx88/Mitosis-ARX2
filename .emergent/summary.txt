<analysis>
The AI engineer's work focused on diagnosing and planning a fix for a critical issue in a Mitosis-based full-stack application. The core problem, identified by the user and confirmed by the AI, was that the frontend was not displaying task execution results, including generated files and tool outputs, because the polling mechanism only fetched task status, not complete execution data. The  field in the frontend's Task interface was consistently empty.

The AI engineer systematically explored the codebase, starting with  to understand the prior context. It then traversed the backend (, ) and frontend (, , ) to pinpoint the data flow discrepancy. Through this analysis, it confirmed the backend *had* the necessary execution data, but the frontend's polling endpoint () did not return it, and the  expected this missing data. The immediate plan is to address this by extending backend capabilities and updating frontend polling.

<product_requirements>
The primary product requirement is to resolve a critical instability issue in a Mitosis-based application where the frontend fails to display complete task execution results. Specifically, the frontend's polling system, which uses HTTP polling to , retrieves only plan steps and their statuses, but *not* the actual execution output, generated files, or  data. The  field within the frontend's  interface remains unpopulated, leading to an incomplete user experience where the task appears stuck at step 1 and results are not delivered. The backend is confirmed to be generating and possessing this data, implying a frontend data fetching/display issue. The solution requires updating the data flow to ensure  is correctly retrieved and displayed.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Application**: React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
- **Frontend Polling**: HTTP-based mechanism () for real-time updates.
- **Data Flow**: Ensuring execution results (, generated files) from backend reach frontend.
- **Environment Variables**:  for frontend API calls,  for backend.
- **Supervisor**: Manages backend (port 8001) and frontend (port 3000) services.
- **Kubernetes Ingress**: Routes  prefixed requests to backend.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with separate  (React) and  (FastAPI) directories, along with  and .

<current_work>
The current work is focused on resolving the critical issue where the frontend fails to display comprehensive task execution results, including generated files and tool outputs. The previous AI engineer thoroughly analyzed the problem, confirming that the frontend's  component polls  but this endpoint, located in , does not return the necessary , specifically . The  component explicitly expects this missing  to render the results.

The current state is that the problem has been fully identified and understood across both the frontend and backend. The immediate next step, as determined by the previous engineer, is to begin the implementation of a solution. This involves creating or modifying a backend endpoint to return the full execution results and then updating the frontend's polling logic and data handling to consume and display this information. The engineer was about to start by implementing the backend change.
