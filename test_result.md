## üß™ **AGENTSTATUS BAR FUNCTIONALITY TESTING COMPLETED** (Julio 2025)

### ‚úÖ **TESTING RESULTS SUMMARY**

**TESTING REQUEST**: Test the AgentStatusBar functionality in the Mitosis application to verify if the agent status bar appears above the chatbox input during task execution.

**TESTING METHODOLOGY**:
1. Navigated to https://d39ad0cf-ceae-4789-8342-97c823a52c3f.preview.emergentagent.com
2. Created tasks to trigger AgentStatusBar functionality
3. Monitored for different agent states during task execution
4. Captured screenshots during task processing
5. Verified WebSearch functionality to test status changes

**TESTING FINDINGS**:

#### ‚úÖ **CORE FUNCTIONALITY WORKING**:
- **Application Loading**: ‚úÖ Welcome page loads correctly with "Bienvenido a Mitosis" title
- **Task Creation**: ‚úÖ Tasks are created successfully when submitting input
- **WebSearch Integration**: ‚úÖ WebSearch button works and creates tasks with "[WebSearch]" prefix
- **Task Processing**: ‚úÖ Tasks are processed by backend and show results
- **Status System**: ‚úÖ Status system is functional - found "Tarea Completada" notifications

#### ‚ùå **AGENTSTATUS BAR COMPONENT ISSUES**:
- **AgentStatusBar Visibility**: ‚ùå The specific AgentStatusBar component was NOT clearly visible above the chatbox input during testing
- **Intermediate States**: ‚ùå Did not capture the expected intermediate states ("Tarea Recibida", "Analizando Tarea", "Ejecutando Paso")
- **Bot Icon**: ‚ùå Bot icon (.lucide-bot) from AgentStatusBar was not found during task execution
- **Status Bar Positioning**: ‚ùå Could not verify if AgentStatusBar appears above the input area as specified

#### üîç **EVIDENCE FOUND**:
- **Status Text**: ‚úÖ Found "Tarea Completada" status text indicating status system is working
- **Task Completion**: ‚úÖ Tasks show completion with green checkmark and "Tarea Completada" notification
- **WebSearch Results**: ‚úÖ WebSearch executes properly and returns actual search results
- **Environment Initialization**: ‚úÖ Tasks show environment setup screens with progress bars

### üéØ **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**:

**POSSIBLE REASONS FOR AGENTSTATUS BAR NOT APPEARING**:
1. **Timing Issue**: Status changes may happen too quickly (< 500ms) to be captured during testing
2. **Positioning Issue**: AgentStatusBar might not be positioned above the chatbox input as expected
3. **Integration Issue**: AgentStatusBar component may not be properly integrated in the current task flow
4. **State Management**: The agentStatus state changes might not be triggering the component visibility correctly

**EVIDENCE OF STATUS SYSTEM WORKING**:
- The status management logic exists in ChatInterface.tsx
- Status changes are implemented (task_received ‚Üí analyzing_task ‚Üí executing_step ‚Üí task_completed)
- "Tarea Completada" notifications appear, indicating the status system backend is functional

### üìä **TESTING VERDICT**:

**OVERALL STATUS**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY WORKING**
- **Backend Status Logic**: ‚úÖ Working (status changes are processed)
- **Task Processing**: ‚úÖ Working (tasks execute and complete successfully)
- **AgentStatusBar Component**: ‚ùå Not visibly confirmed during task execution
- **User Experience**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Users may not see intermediate status updates during task processing

### üîß **RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MAIN AGENT**:

1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Verify AgentStatusBar component positioning and visibility during task execution
2. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Check if AgentStatusBar timing is too fast for user visibility
3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Add longer delays or more prominent status indicators for better user feedback
4. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Ensure AgentStatusBar appears above chatbox input as specified in requirements
5. **LOW PRIORITY**: Consider adding debug logging to track AgentStatusBar state changes

### üì∏ **VISUAL EVIDENCE**:
- Screenshots captured showing task creation and completion
- WebSearch functionality working with proper task creation
- "Tarea Completada" status notifications visible
- Environment initialization screens working properly

## üß™ BUTTON FIXES TESTING COMPLETED (Enero 2025)

### ‚úÖ **TESTING REQUEST FULFILLED**

**TESTING REQUEST**: Test the fixes made to the button functionality in the Mitosis task management application for two specific issues:
1. **FAVORITES button (FAVORITO) - Star Fill Issue**: The star should be FILLED (solid) when favorited, not just outlined
2. **FILES button (ARCHIVOS) - UI Theme Issue**: The FilesModal should have a DARK/GRAY theme, not white

**TESTING METHODOLOGY**:
1. Navigated to https://d39ad0cf-ceae-4789-8342-97c823a52c3f.preview.emergentagent.com
2. Created test task to access task view with the buttons
3. Tested FAVORITES button star fill functionality
4. Tested FILES button modal theme consistency
5. Captured screenshots and analyzed visual changes

**TESTING RESULTS**:

#### ‚ùå **FAVORITES BUTTON - STAR FILL ISSUE NOT FIXED**:
- **Button Visibility**: ‚úÖ FAVORITES button found and clickable in task header
- **Button Background Change**: ‚ùå Button does NOT turn yellow when favorited (stays gray)
- **Star Fill Issue**: ‚ùå Star does NOT become FILLED/SOLID when favorited (remains outline)
- **Toggle Functionality**: ‚úÖ Button responds to clicks but visual changes not applied
- **Code Analysis**: The conditional classes exist in TaskView.tsx but `task.isFavorite` state is not being updated properly

#### ‚úÖ **FILES BUTTON - UI THEME ISSUE FIXED**:
- **Button Visibility**: ‚úÖ FILES button found and clickable in task header
- **Modal Opening**: ‚úÖ FilesModal opens successfully when clicked
- **Dark Background**: ‚úÖ Modal has dark background (#272728) as required
- **Light Text**: ‚úÖ Modal title has light text color (#DADADA)
- **Dark Theme Tabs**: ‚úÖ Tabs have proper dark theme styling with appropriate colors
- **Consistent Theme**: ‚úÖ Overall modal matches the dark theme of the rest of the application

### üìä **DETAILED FINDINGS**:

**FAVORITES Button Code Analysis**:
```tsx
// The code exists but task.isFavorite state is not updating
className={`${task.isFavorite ? 'bg-yellow-500/20 hover:bg-yellow-500/30 text-yellow-400' : 'bg-[#4A4A4C] hover:bg-[#5A5A5C] text-[#DADADA]'}`}
<Star className={`w-3 h-3 ${task.isFavorite ? 'fill-yellow-400 text-yellow-400' : ''}`} />
```

**FILES Modal Theme Analysis**:
```tsx
// Dark theme properly implemented
<div className="bg-[#272728] rounded-lg shadow-xl max-w-4xl w-full max-h-[90vh] flex flex-col border border-[rgba(255,255,255,0.08)]">
<h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[#DADADA]">Archivos Generados</h2>
```

### üéØ **FINAL ASSESSMENT**:

**FAVORITES Button Fix**: ‚ùå **NOT WORKING**
- Root Cause: The `task.isFavorite` property is not being properly updated in the task state when the button is clicked
- Visual Impact: Star remains outline instead of becoming filled/solid
- Button Impact: Background remains gray instead of turning yellow

**FILES Modal Theme Fix**: ‚úÖ **WORKING CORRECTLY**
- Dark background (#272728) implemented correctly
- Light text colors (#DADADA) applied properly
- Tabs have appropriate dark theme styling
- Overall theme consistency achieved

### üîß **RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MAIN AGENT**:

1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Fix FAVORITES button state management - the `onUpdateTask` call is not properly updating the `task.isFavorite` property
2. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Verify that the task state is being persisted and propagated correctly through the component hierarchy
3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Test the favorites functionality end-to-end to ensure state persistence
4. **LOW PRIORITY**: FILES modal theme is working correctly - no action needed

### üì∏ **VISUAL EVIDENCE**:
- Screenshots captured showing FAVORITES button not changing appearance when clicked
- Screenshots captured showing FILES modal with proper dark theme implementation
- Visual confirmation that one fix is working while the other needs attention

**ACTUAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**:
1. **Infrastructure Instability**: Vite development mode causing constant WebSocket failures and resource loading issues
2. **API Routing Problem**: Backend endpoints not accessible from frontend URL (404 errors)
3. **Component Loading Failures**: Configuration components fail to load due to development mode instability
4. **Network Connectivity**: Frontend cannot communicate with backend APIs properly

**EVIDENCE**:
- Configuration panel opens successfully when clicked
- Modal renders correctly with proper styling and structure
- Issues are caused by development mode instability, not component functionality
- Backend APIs work correctly but are not accessible from frontend routing

### üîß **CRITICAL FINDINGS**:

#### ‚úÖ **WHAT IS WORKING**:
1. **ConfigPanel Component**: ‚úÖ Renders correctly and opens when button is clicked
2. **Modal Functionality**: ‚úÖ Dark overlay, close button, and modal structure work properly
3. **Button Integration**: ‚úÖ Configuration button properly triggers modal opening
4. **Component Architecture**: ‚úÖ React state management for modal opening/closing works

#### ‚ùå **WHAT NEEDS FIXING**:
1. **Production Mode**: Switch from Vite development to production static file serving
2. **API Routing**: Fix backend API accessibility from frontend URL
3. **Resource Loading**: Resolve module loading failures causing component instability
4. **WebSocket Configuration**: Address constant WebSocket connection failures

### üìä **TESTING VERDICT**:

**CONFIGURATION PANEL STATUS**: ‚úÖ **WORKING CORRECTLY**
- Modal opens and renders properly
- UI components are functional
- React state management works as expected

**INFRASTRUCTURE STATUS**: ‚ùå **CRITICAL ISSUES**

2. **CRITICAL PRIORITY**: Fix backend API routing - ensure `/api/agent/ollama/*` endpoints are accessible from frontend
3. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Resolve Vite WebSocket configuration issues causing constant failures
4. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Test Ollama configuration functionality after infrastructure fixes
5. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Verify all configuration tabs (Prompt, Memoria, Ollama, OpenRouter, Herramientas) work properly
6. **LOW PRIORITY**: ConfigPanel component itself is working - no component fixes needed

### üì∏ **VISUAL EVIDENCE**:
- Screenshots confirm configuration panel opens successfully
- Modal appears with proper dark overlay and "Configuraci√≥n del Agente" title
- UI structure is correct but affected by development mode instability
- Console logs show extensive WebSocket failures and resource loading errors

### üèÜ **CONCLUSION**:
**The configuration panel IS WORKING** - the previous diagnosis was incorrect. The real issues are:
1. **Infrastructure problems** (development mode instability)
2. **API routing issues** (backend not accessible from frontend)
3. **Resource loading failures** (affecting component stability)

Once these infrastructure issues are resolved, the Ollama configuration should be fully functional as the component architecture is already working correctly.

**TESTING RESULTS**:

#### ‚úÖ **CORE FUNCTIONALITY - ALL WORKING CORRECTLY**:
- **Application Loading**: ‚úÖ Welcome page loads correctly
- **Configuration Panel**: ‚úÖ Opens successfully when clicking "Configuraci√≥n" button
- **Ollama Tab**: ‚úÖ Accessible and displays Ollama configuration options
- **Endpoint Input**: ‚úÖ Found and functional - can change from localhost to ngrok endpoint
- **Verify Button**: ‚úÖ Present and triggers API calls when clicked
- **Network Communication**: ‚úÖ Frontend-backend communication working perfectly

#### ‚úÖ **BACKEND API INTEGRATION - FULLY FUNCTIONAL**:
- **API Calls Made**: ‚úÖ 7 successful network requests captured during testing
- **Connection Check**: ‚úÖ `/api/agent/ollama/check` endpoint responding with status 200
- **Models Fetch**: ‚úÖ `/api/agent/ollama/models` endpoint responding with status 200
- **Real Data Retrieved**: ‚úÖ Backend returns actual connection status and model list

#### ‚úÖ **BACKEND VERIFICATION - CONFIRMED WORKING**:
- **Direct API Test Results**:
  - Connection Check: `{'status': 200, 'data': {'endpoint': 'https://78d08925604a.ngrok-free.app', 'is_connected': True, 'timestamp': '2025-07-15T13:49:10.682618'}}`
  - Models List: `{'status': 200, 'data': {'endpoint': 'https://78d08925604a.ngrok-free.app', 'models': ['llava:latest', 'tinyllama:latest', 'llama3.1:8b', 'magistral:24b', 'qwen3:32b', 'deepseek-r1:32b', 'MFDoom/deepseek-r1-tool-calling:32b', 'deepseek-r1:8b', 'llama3:latest'], 'timestamp': '2025-07-15T13:49:11.516590'}}`

#### ‚ùå **FRONTEND UI STATE MANAGEMENT ISSUE IDENTIFIED**:
- **Connection Status Display**: ‚ùå Shows "Desconectado" and "No se pudo conectar con el endpoint de Ollama" despite backend returning `is_connected: true`
- **Models Dropdown**: ‚ùå Shows "Seleccionar modelo..." instead of populated model list despite backend returning 9 models
- **UI State Updates**: ‚ùå Frontend not properly updating UI state based on successful API responses

### üéØ **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**:

**PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**: The issue is NOT with backend functionality or API communication. The backend is working perfectly and returning correct data. The issue is in the **frontend UI state management** in the `useOllamaConnection` hook.

**EVIDENCE**:
1. **Backend Working**: API calls return `is_connected: true` and 9 models successfully
2. **Network Working**: All HTTP requests return status 200
3. **Data Retrieved**: Backend provides correct connection status and model list
4. **Frontend Issue**: UI components not updating to reflect the successful API responses

**SPECIFIC ISSUE LOCATION**: The `useOllamaConnection.ts` hook is not properly updating the React state variables (`isConnected`, `models`) when the API responses are successful.

### üìä **DETAILED FINDINGS**:

#### Network Activity Analysis:
- **Total Requests**: 7 successful POST requests to Ollama endpoints
- **Request Types**: 
  - 5x `/api/agent/ollama/check` calls
  - 2x `/api/agent/ollama/models` calls
- **Response Status**: All returned HTTP 200 (success)
- **Data Flow**: Backend ‚Üí Frontend communication working perfectly

#### UI State Analysis:
- **Expected Behavior**: Connection status should show "Conectado" and models should populate dropdown
- **Actual Behavior**: Shows "Desconectado" and empty model dropdown
- **State Management**: React state not updating despite successful API responses

### üîß **TECHNICAL DIAGNOSIS**:

**The user's report of "FAILED TO FETCH" and models not loading is accurate, but the cause is frontend state management, not backend or network issues.**

**Issue Location**: `/app/frontend/src/hooks/useOllamaConnection.ts`
- The hook receives successful API responses but fails to update React state
- State variables `isConnected` and `models` not being set correctly
- Error handling may be interfering with success state updates

### üìã **RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MAIN AGENT**:

1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Fix `useOllamaConnection.ts` hook state management
   - Ensure `setIsConnected(true)` is called when API returns `is_connected: true`
   - Ensure `setModels()` is called with the models array from API response
   - Review error handling logic that might be overriding success states

2. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Debug React state updates in the hook
   - Add console logging to track state changes
   - Verify that successful API responses trigger state updates
   - Check for race conditions in async state updates

3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Test the complete flow after fixing state management
   - Verify connection status displays correctly
   - Verify models populate in dropdown
   - Test endpoint switching functionality

### üì∏ **VISUAL EVIDENCE**:
- Screenshots show configuration panel working correctly
- Connection status incorrectly showing "Desconectado" despite successful API calls
- Models dropdown showing "Seleccionar modelo..." instead of available models
- Network tab confirms successful API communication

### üèÜ **CONCLUSION**:
**The Ollama configuration functionality is 90% working correctly**. The backend, API communication, and network requests are all functioning perfectly. The only issue is frontend UI state management not reflecting the successful API responses. This is a specific React state management bug in the `useOllamaConnection` hook, not a broader system issue.

   - Verify no Vite development server is running

2. **URGENT PRIORITY**: Fix backend API connectivity
   - Resolve 502 errors for `/api/agent/ollama/*` endpoints
   - Ensure backend service is running and accessible
   - Verify API routing configuration

3. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Resolve WebSocket configuration
   - Ensure application WebSocket (not Vite HMR) is properly configured
   - Test Socket.IO connection to backend
   - Verify WebSocket events are properly handled

4. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Test infrastructure stability
   - Ensure application loads completely without errors
   - Verify all JavaScript modules load successfully
   - Test basic functionality before WebSocket features

### üì∏ **VISUAL EVIDENCE**:
- Screenshots show application stuck in loading state with placeholder elements
- No actual content loaded due to infrastructure failures
- Console filled with development mode errors and WebSocket failures

### üèÜ **CONCLUSION**:

**THE AUTONOMOUS WEBSOCKET SYSTEM CANNOT BE TESTED** due to the same recurring infrastructure issues that have been reported multiple times. The application must be properly switched to production mode and backend connectivity must be restored before any WebSocket or autonomous system testing can be performed.

**RECOMMENDATION**: Fix the fundamental infrastructure issues first, then re-request comprehensive WebSocket testing.

3. **Button Disabling**: La l√≥gica de deshabilitaci√≥n durante procesamiento no funciona

**EVIDENCIA**:
- Console logs muestran que WebSearch funciona: "‚úÖ WebSearch response received"
- Console logs NO muestran actividad para DeepSearch
- Los botones no cambian su texto durante procesamiento
- Network monitoring confirma 0 requests para DeepSearch

### üìã **RECOMENDACIONES PARA EL MAIN AGENT:**

1. **ALTA PRIORIDAD**: Corregir la funci√≥n `handleDeepSearch` en `VanishInput.tsx` - no est√° ejecutando `onDeepSearch`
2. **ALTA PRIORIDAD**: Implementar correctamente los estados "Buscando..." y "Investigando..." en los botones
3. **ALTA PRIORIDAD**: Implementar la l√≥gica de deshabilitaci√≥n de botones durante procesamiento
4. **MEDIA PRIORIDAD**: Verificar que `onDeepSearch` en `App.tsx` est√© siendo llamado correctamente

## üß™ ENVIRONMENT INITIALIZATION TESTING COMPLETED (Enero 2025)

### ‚úÖ **WELCOME PAGE FUNCTIONALITY VERIFIED:**

#### 1. **Welcome Page UI Layout**
- ‚úÖ **Title Display**: "Bienvenido a Mitosis" title displays correctly without overlapping
- ‚úÖ **Subtitle Display**: "¬øQu√© puedo hacer por ti?" subtitle displays correctly
- ‚úÖ **Input Field**: Textarea input field is visible and functional
- ‚úÖ **Internal Buttons**: All 4 internal buttons (Adjuntar, Web, Deep, Voz) are visible and clickable
- ‚úÖ **Suggestion Buttons**: 5 suggestion buttons (P√°gina web, Presentaci√≥n, App, Investigaci√≥n, Juego) are working

#### 2. **Task Creation Process**
- ‚úÖ **Input Processing**: Input field accepts text and processes form submission
- ‚úÖ **Navigation**: Successfully navigates away from welcome page when task is created
- ‚úÖ **Form Submission**: Both Enter key and send button work for task creation

### ‚ùå **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:**

#### 1. **Environment Initialization Display BROKEN**
- ‚ùå **Terminal/Monitor Section**: No terminal or monitor section found after task creation
- ‚ùå **OFFLINE/ONLINE Status**: No status indicators (OFFLINE/ONLINE) found
- ‚ùå **Initialization Steps**: No initialization steps displayed ("Setting up environment", "Installing dependencies", "Initializing agent")
- ‚ùå **Task View Loading**: Task view shows loading placeholders instead of actual content

#### 2. **Environment Initialization Process NOT WORKING**
- ‚ùå **Missing Terminal View**: The terminal/computer section that should show initialization is not rendering
- ‚ùå **No Status Tracking**: System does not show OFFLINE during initialization or ONLINE when complete
- ‚ùå **Missing Initialization Logs**: No environment setup logs are displayed in the terminal section

### üîç **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**

**PROBLEM**: The environment initialization functionality is implemented in the code but not working properly:

1. **Code Implementation**: The `EnvironmentSetupLoader.tsx`, `TerminalView.tsx`, and initialization logic exist in the codebase
2. **Task Creation**: Tasks are created successfully and navigation works
3. **Rendering Issue**: The task view renders loading placeholders instead of the actual terminal/monitor content
4. **Missing Integration**: The initialization process is not being triggered or displayed properly

**EVIDENCE**:
- Welcome page loads correctly with all UI elements
- Task creation navigation works (moves away from welcome page)
- After task creation, page shows loading placeholders instead of terminal content
- No terminal/monitor elements found in DOM after task creation
- No OFFLINE/ONLINE status indicators present

### üìã **TESTING RESULTS SUMMARY:**

| Feature | Status | Details |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Welcome Page Title | ‚úÖ WORKING | "Bienvenido a Mitosis" displays correctly |
| Task Creation | ‚úÖ WORKING | Input field and form submission work |
| Navigation | ‚úÖ WORKING | Successfully moves from welcome to task view |
| Terminal/Monitor Section | ‚ùå BROKEN | Not rendering after task creation |
| OFFLINE/ONLINE Status | ‚ùå BROKEN | No status indicators found |
| Initialization Steps | ‚ùå BROKEN | No initialization process displayed |
| Environment Setup | ‚ùå BROKEN | Complete initialization system not working |

### üéØ **VERIFICATION STATUS:**

- **Requirement 1**: ‚úÖ Welcome page loads correctly with "Bienvenido a Mitosis" title
- **Requirement 2**: ‚ùå Initialization does NOT appear at the top (good - no "RARA" way)
- **Requirement 3**: ‚ùå Terminal/computer section does NOT show initialization steps
- **Requirement 4**: ‚ùå Status does NOT show "OFFLINE" during initialization or "ONLINE" when complete
- **Requirement 5**: ‚ùå Initialization process is NOT displayed with required steps

**OVERALL RESULT**: ‚ùå **ENVIRONMENT INITIALIZATION FUNCTIONALITY IS BROKEN**

The DeepResearch queries are submitted but not processing/completing, which means no files are being created, and therefore no enhanced file display components can render. The issue is deeper than just the frontend components - it's a backend/integration problem where DeepResearch is not functioning properly. The enhanced file display fix cannot work until the DeepResearch system is fixed to actually create files.

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The enhanced file display functionality is not working due to two critical issues: 1) Backend DeepResearch functionality is not operational (Ollama dependency issue), 2) Frontend FileUploadParser component logic is not detecting file upload success patterns and rendering enhanced components. CONCLUSION: The file upload functionality fix is NOT working as intended. While basic file upload modal works, the core enhanced file display features (colored icons, dropdown menus, file action buttons) that users expect are completely non-functional.

    message: "DEBUGGING TEST COMPLETED AS REQUESTED: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED FOR TASKS NOT APPEARING IN SIDEBAR. ‚úÖ BACKEND INTEGRATION WORKING: HTTP calls to /api/agent/chat and /api/agent/create-test-files successful (2 calls each), console logs show successful task creation ('üöÄ Creating test files for task: task-1752316222122', '‚úÖ Archivos creados autom√°ticamente para la tarea: [WebSearch] test query for debugging'). ‚ùå CRITICAL REACT STATE/RENDERING ISSUE: Tasks are created in React state but NOT rendered in DOM (0 task elements found, task counter remains 0). This exactly matches user's reported issue: 'abre una nueva tarea pero no muestra ni la webSearch'. ROOT CAUSE: React state management issue - tasks array is updated in App.tsx but Sidebar component is not re-rendering the new tasks. URGENT: Fix React state propagation between App.tsx and Sidebar.tsx components. Infrastructure issue persists: app still running in development mode with WebSocket failures."

    message: "USER VERIFICATION REQUEST RESULTS - CRITICAL BACKEND FAILURE DISCOVERED: Unable to verify the requested corrections due to complete backend infrastructure failure. ‚ùå BACKEND STATUS: Flask server failing to start due to missing Flask dependency in requirements.txt (ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'), ‚ùå API ENDPOINTS: All backend endpoints returning no response (curl tests fail), ‚ùå TASK CREATION: Cannot create tasks to test Plan de Acci√≥n icons because backend is down, ‚ùå INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE: Supervisor trying to run uvicorn with Flask app causing startup failure. ROOT CAUSE: Backend server.py uses Flask but Flask not installed, requirements.txt contains invalid built-in module names instead of actual dependencies. ‚úÖ POSITIVE FINDINGS: No mockup files appear automatically (correct behavior), Frontend UI loads properly. URGENT: Backend infrastructure must be completely fixed before any UI corrections can be verified. The user's specific requests about Plan de Acci√≥n icons cannot be tested until backend is operational."
