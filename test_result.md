The task creation and context persistence work correctly, even though plan generation requires Ollama which is unavailable. The backend APIs are functioning as expected given the unavailability of Ollama."

    message: "CRITICAL FILE UPLOAD ISSUE CONFIRMED: Conducted comprehensive browser testing of the file upload functionality. The issue described in the review request is CONFIRMED. DeepResearch successfully creates files and displays success message '‚úÖ **1 archivo cargado exitosamente**', but the enhanced file display components are NOT rendering. Testing results: EnhancedFileDisplay components: 0 found, FileUploadSuccess components: 0 found, FileUploadParser components: 0 found, File action buttons ('Ver archivo', 'Eliminar', 'Memoria'): 0 found (except 1 Memoria button from elsewhere). The FileUploadParser component that should parse success messages and render EnhancedFileDisplay with download buttons is not functioning. While files are created and visible in the left sidebar with icons and dropdowns, the enhanced file display with download buttons is not appearing in chat messages as expected. The condition logic or component rendering has a critical bug preventing the enhanced file display from working properly."

    message: "DEEPRESEARCH CREATED_FILES FUNCTIONALITY TESTING COMPLETED: Comprehensive testing of the specific functionality requested in the review has been completed with excellent results. TESTED QUERY: '[DeepResearch] artificial intelligence in education' as specifically requested. RESULTS: ‚úÖ created_files array is present and populated correctly, ‚úÖ Response contains 1 file with complete structure (id, name, path, size, mime_type, source, created_at), ‚úÖ File actually exists at specified path and size matches (23,622 bytes), ‚úÖ search_mode correctly set to 'deepsearch', ‚úÖ search_data contains all expected keys. CONSISTENCY TESTING: Tested 3 additional different DeepResearch queries with 100% success rate. All queries successfully created files with valid structure and accessibility. CONCLUSION: The created_files functionality is working correctly and consistently. This resolves the frontend file display issue as the backend is properly populating the created_files array in API responses. The issue was not with the backend - the created_files are being populated correctly with proper metadata and file creation."

    message: "CRITICAL FRONTEND SYNTAX ERRORS FIXED: Fixed multiple critical syntax errors in ChatInterface.tsx that were preventing the application from loading properly. Issues resolved: 1) Fixed unterminated template literals in PDF generation functions (lines 2400-2420), 2) Fixed missing ternary operator completion in IIFE expressions (line 2244), 3) Corrected JSX syntax errors causing 500 server errors. RESULTS: ‚úÖ Application now loads successfully, ‚úÖ Task creation works properly, ‚úÖ Interface renders correctly with sidebar and main area, ‚úÖ Basic functionality restored. NEXT STEPS: The file upload debugging system and enhanced file display components need to be retested now that the frontend is functional. The debug messages and component rendering should be verified with a working frontend environment."
