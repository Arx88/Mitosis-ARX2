Deep Research Is Epic, But Only If You Know How to Use it
Contents
Why Should You Care?
Deep research is a powerful feature, offering highly detailed, real-world insights that can support diverse research functions from trend forecasting to complex multidisciplinary analysis. However, clear prompting, patience, and domain-specific expertise is crucial to unlock its full value. Importantly, deep research outputs aren‚Äôt immune to errors, and should be treated as augmented input‚Äînot autonomous conclusions. To make the most of this feature, businesses should employ it in areas they understand, approach queries with clear intent, and always apply critical review and human oversight before acting on results.

Senior reporter, AI & work
My first few jobs out of college were in research roles‚Äîfirst, as a research assistant for a business school professor and then a historian, and then as a researcher for a podcast network. A good amount of the work I do at Charter still involves research. So my interest was piqued when OpenAI released its new
deep research tool
, which can conduct in-depth research and generate detailed reports with citations.
Deep research has garnered a lot of praise over the past few weeks. Tech journalist Casey Newton
wrote
that it ‚Äúmight be the first good agent.‚Äù Economist and blogger Tyler Cowen
wrote
that he thinks about its ‚Äúquality as comparable to having a good PhD-level research assistant, and sending that person away with a task for a week or two, or maybe more.‚Äù OpenAI CEO Sam Altman
described
it as ‚Äúone of my favorite things we have ever shipped‚Äù and
estimated
that it ‚Äúcan do a single-digit percentage of all economically valuable tasks in the w...

What is ChatGPT deep research?
By
Harry Guinness
¬∑
March 10, 2025
ChatGPT has a powerful new feature called Deep Research. It combines two of ChatGPT's recent developments,
a reasoning model
and
ChatGPT Search
, so that it can do deep dives into any topic you want. It's the kind of feature that's long been heralded as a transformative use of AI.
OpenAI is even referring to Deep Research as "agentic." While
AI agents
are a hot topic at the moment, in this instance, all it means is that ChatGPT can browse the web by itself without any input from you. It's some amount of autonomy, yes, but it's a far cry from Skynet.
I've been writing about all of ChatGPT's developments, so I was excited to try out Deep Research and see how it stacks up. Let's dive in.
As always, OpenAI has given this new feature an awkward name. It's called deep research (all lower case), but I'm going to go with Deep Research (both words capitalized) to distinguish it from ...

I Tested Deep Research Tools‚ÄîThey‚Äôre not all made equal
I used to get paid for deep research.
Now? AI does it in minutes.
No joke‚Äîif I had these tools while working on my PhD, I‚Äôd have saved half the time, drank less coffee, and maybe even kept my muscle mass.
AI can now:
Scan 40+ sources.
Process them with cutting-edge models.
Deliver a
10,000-word research report in minutes
.
The game has changed.

In an era when data is abundant and time is at a premium, innovative tools like Deep Research are reshaping how we approach complex analysis and content creation.
In February 2025,
OpenAI introduced Deep Research
‚Äîa cutting-edge feature currently available for all ChatGPT paid users. Designed to perform advanced searches and reason across diverse datasets, Deep Research offers a new way to generate literature reviews, discussion papers, technical insights, and even newsletters.
In this post, I‚Äôll explore how Deep Research can serve as a powerful ally for MIT Sloan faculty members, staff, and teaching assistants who are engaged in the creation of learning materials, along with some pitfalls to consider when using these tools. By unpacking a detailed case study example on ‚ÄúExpectations Management and the Earnings Game,‚Äù I‚Äôll consider both the tool‚Äôs potential and its practical considerations.
