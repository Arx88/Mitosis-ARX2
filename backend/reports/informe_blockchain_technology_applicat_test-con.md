Introduction and summary
Blockchain technology is likely to be a key source of future financial market innovation. It allows for the creation of immutable records of transactions accessible by all participants in a network. A blockchain database is made up of a number of blocks “chained” together through a reference in each block to the previous block. Each block records one or more transactions, which are essentially changes in the listed owner of assets. New blocks are added to the existing chain through a consensus mechanism in which members of the blockchain network confirm transactions as valid. The technology allows the creation of a network that is “fully peer to peer, with no trusted third party,” such as a government agency or financial institution.

Popular blockchain use cases across industries
Most people have heard something about blockchain technologies, likely in relation to the transaction of cryptocurrencies. Blockchain as we currently know it was introduced with the first ever cryptocurrency — Bitcoin — in 2009, and has since taken over the cryptocurrency market.
As it turns out, the popularity of blockchain technology in crypto contexts is due to its dynamic, decentralized, and transparent nature, which lends itself to applications across industries and tasks. Blockchain is one of the newest tools on the market, and many businesses have already taken notice.
How does blockchain technology work?
Blockchain technology is not always the easiest to understand, and the topic is further complicated with specific terminology and references to the minutiae of the system. So whether or not you know what a merkle tree is, taking a look at the basics of the system can provide insight as to why this technology is so fascinating.

It makes sense that
blockchain technology
was first introduced as a way to breathe some fresh air into the
financial sector
. Originally created at the height of the 2008 global financial crisis as the operational backbone of Bitcoin, blockchain’s
distributed ledger technology
is a safe and secure method to transfer and catalog data.
In short, blockchain is a public ledger capable of recording the origin, movement and transfer of
anything of value
. Instead of relying on a central authority, like banks, blockchain requires unanimous approval from the individual nodes in the blockchain to
process a payment
or transfer a good. The ledger technology is most attractive to the financial sector because it solves many problems plaguing the industry today, namely
security
and efficiency.

Smart contracts
Simplified payment processing
Advanced trading and investing

The 2009 launch of Bitcoin moved blockchain from theoretical to real-world use, demonstrating that this digital
distributed ledger technology
works. Since then, organizations have been testing how they, too, can make blockchain work for them.
Big-name companies, government agencies and nonprofit entities are
using blockchain to improve existing processes and enable new business models
.
The value of blockchain stems from its ability to share data in a secure way among entities, without any one entity having to take responsibility for safeguarding the data or facilitating the transactions.
"It's a ledger of transactions that have unique characteristics, and those characteristics help address problems in our systems and processes," said Ayman Omar,...

The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) sent shockwaves around the world, as it is the largest bank failure in the US since the global recession of 2008. Governments are currently trying to assess the impact on tech start-ups, financial institutions and pension funds.
The financial system of Silicon Valley Bank is becoming increasingly opaque and vulnerable to collapse. This has caused some experts to call for the adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrency in order to increase transparency, reduce financial risk, and create a more secure financial system.
Bitcoin, in particular, has been suggested as an ideal currency for such purposes due to its decentralised nature
.
‍
The Power of Blockchain
In the context of the SVB Bank, the possible role of cryptocurrencies compared to the opaque financial system is coming into the spotlight. Let’s have a look how blockchain technology can help prevent such problems in several ways:
Increased transparency:
