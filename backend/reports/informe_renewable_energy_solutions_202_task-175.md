,
Chiara Gulli
As we enter a new year, the
race between tipping points
is clearer than ever. 2024 was likely the
hottest year on record
,
raising the risk
of
earth system tipping points
if we fail to speed up solutions.
But despite
warnings
of a
slowdown
, solutions continue to race forward. As cleantech becomes cheaper than ever, 2024 saw
record uptake
in renewable energy, electric vehicles (EVs), and more. These
positive tipping points
are happening worldwide ‚Äî with major progress in
China
and the
Global South
. Let‚Äôs review what that means for the year ahead.
Costs falling fast
. Solar module prices fell 35 percent to 9 cents per watt; EV batteries are now below $100/kWh and often at cost parity with their fossil-fueled competition.
Cleantech growing globally
