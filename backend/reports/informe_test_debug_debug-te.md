Testing and Debugging are important processes in software engineering. Testing and Debugging seems to be similar but they are quite different. The main difference between Testing and Debugging are testing is the process of identifying defects or errors in the software system while debugging is the process to to fix those defects or errors that affect the working of software.
Differences between Testing and Debugging
What is Testing?
Testing
is the process of verifying and validating that a software or application is bug-free, meets the technical requirements as guided by its design and development, and meets the user requirements effectively and efficiently by handling all the exceptional and boundary cases.¬†The purpose of software testing is to identify the errors, faults, or missing requirements in contrast to actual requirements.

About
TestComplete includes two debuggers: the
keyword test debugger
and the
script debugger
as an aid in developing your keyword tests and scripts. Debugging refers to halting the test execution on a certain keyword test operation or script line and then running through the test in step with the execution, stopping on operations or script lines. Every time the debugger stops somewhere, there are several things it will allow you to do, such as to check or change the values of variables. However, merely stopping before certain operations or lines is often a great help in trac...

Testing and debugging are two of the most common processes found in development teams. At first glance, they may appear similar, but they are indeed quite different. Testing is finding defects while debugging is locating their cause in the code and fixing them. Let's look at each in detail.
What is Testing?
Testing is carried out by testers either by executing test cases or by
ad hoc testing
. The main objective of testing is to find defects in the software. The tester does
functional testing
to search flaws in the end-user functionality and
non-functional testing
to find faults in operational areas like performance and security.  Testing can also happen at different levels -
unit testing
,
integration testing
,
system testing
, and
acceptance testing
- with the overall strategy to find bugs as early as possible.
The output of testing is a
defect report
. This report lists the exact steps to duplicate the
defect
so that developers can locate the source of the bug and fix it.

Debugging lets you fix logical errors and check whether your tests run correctly. TestComplete includes two types of debuggers: script debugger and debugger of keyword tests (or keyword test debugger). These debuggers include all modern debugging features: breakpoints, tracing into routines or tests and stepping over them, the call stack, watch list, expression evaluation, and so forth. Though the functionality of these debuggers differs a little (for instance, the way you set breakpoints in script code differs from the way you do this in keyword tests), the debuggers are very similar. They have the same me...

VS Code debugger
‚Äã
We recommend using the
VS Code Extension
for debugging for a better developer experience. With the VS Code extension you can debug your tests right in VS Code, see error messages, set breakpoints and step through your tests.
Error Messages
‚Äã
If your test fails VS Code will show you error messages right in the editor showing what was expected, what was received as well as a complete call log.
Live Debugging
‚Äã
You can debug your test live in VS Code. After running a test with the
Show Browser
option checked, click on any of the locators in VS Code and it will be highlighted in the Browser window. Playwright will also show you if there are multiple matches.
You can also edit the locators in VS Code and Playwright will show you the changes live in the browser window.

Debug and analyze unit tests by using Test Explorer
2025-03-31
Feedback
You can use Test Explorer to start a debugging session for your tests. Stepping through your code with the Visual Studio debugger seamlessly takes you back and forth between the unit tests and the project under test.
To start debugging:
In the Visual Studio editor, set a breakpoint in one or more test methods that you want to debug.
Note
Because test methods can run in any order, set breakpoints in all the test methods that you want to debug.
In Test Explorer, select the test methods, right-click somewhere on the pane, and then select
Debug
.
For more information about the debugger, see

Software debugging is the process of finding, analyzing, and resolving errors in a software application. It‚Äôs an essential part of software development, and your team will reap significant benefits from developing an efficient and effective software debugging process.
Understanding the right tools and techniques to use will help your team save time and money and create a great final product.
Debugging and Testing: How They Work Together
Software Testing
Software testing is a systematic process designed to identify any bugs or defects that may be present in the software. Through a series of structured tests, developers aim to ensure that the software functions as intended, meets specified requirements, and provides a seamless user experience. Once the software tests have spotted potential issues, your team can move into the debugging phase.

A set of simple techniques that I use personally to make the debugging of automation tests as smooth as possible
It may sound like a cliche, but the idea of this article came to me in a dream. I was dreaming about speaking at a conference and the topic I was talking about was the ways of debugging your automation tests. I woke up and noted down the idea for the article. Today, around 2 months later, I finally found time to share my thoughts with you.
Debugging skills matter
So, why do they matter? Simply, because during your work you will spend more time debugging tests than time creating them. So, while writing test code the main focus should be on keeping this code well maintainable and debuggable for the sake of future you and your teammates.
Debugging is not an art, but just a set of techniques that, applied thoroughly, will help you find a bug in code. It may be surprisin...

Different Techniques Of Debugging Selenium Based Test Scripts
Writing and maintaining the test automation code is not always a piece of cake. As a matter of fact, we frequently face
many scenarios
where automated test cases don‚Äôt work as expected and might lead to false positive or false negative results, in such cases, debugging is the only way out. Debugging is the primary skill set that an automation tester must adopt. It increases the morale and confidence in automation testers to provide a better code solution to fix the problem permanently.
Debugging issues in the
test automation framework
becomes more complicated when the test automation framework has a huge number of test cases. With the expansion of features in the application, the number of test cases gradually increases. In ...

Debugging Techniques
Testing a program against a well-chosen set of input tests gives the
programmer confidence that the program is correct. During the testing
process, the programmer observes input-output relationships, that is, the
output that the program produces for each input test case.  If the
program produces the expected output and obeys the specification for
each test case, then the program is successfully tested.
But if the output for one of the test cases is not the one expected, then the program is
incorrect -- it contains
errors
(or
defects
, or "
bugs
"). In
such situations, testing only reveals the presence of errors, but doesn't tell us what the
errors are, or how the code needs to be
fixed. In other words, testing reveals the
effects
(or
symptoms
) of
errors, not the
cause
of errors. The programmer
must then go through a debugging process, to identify the causes and fix the
errors.
