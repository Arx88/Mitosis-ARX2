What is machine learning (ML)?
Today‚Äôs enterprises are inundated with data, and making sense of it can greatly help businesses make better decisions. But the sheer volume coupled with complexity often makes data difficult to analyze using traditional tools. Building, testing, iterating, and deploying analytical models for identifying patterns and insights in data eats up employees‚Äô time in a way that scales poorly. Machine learning can enable an organization to derive insights quickly as data scales.

What is machine learning?
Machine learning (ML) is a branch of
artificial intelligence (AI)
focused on enabling computers and machines to imitate the way that humans learn, to perform tasks autonomously, and to improve their performance and accuracy through experience and exposure to more data.
UC Berkeley
breaks out the learning system of a machine learning algorithm into three main parts.
A Decision Process: In general, machine learning algorithms are used to make a prediction or classification. Based on some input data, which can be labeled or unlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about a pattern in the data.
An Error Function: An error function evaluates the prediction of the model. If there are known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess the accuracy of the model.
A Model Optimization Process: If the model can fit better to the data points in the training...

How It Works
Evolution of machine learning
Because of new computing technologies, machine learning today is not like machine learning of the past. It was born from pattern recognition and the theory that computers can learn without being programmed to perform specific tasks; researchers interested in artificial intelligence wanted to see if computers could learn from data.¬†The iterative aspect of machine learning is important because as models are exposed to new data, they can independently adapt. They learn from previous computations to produce reliabl...
