Machine learning and medical diagnosis: disease detection
Introduction
Today, AI plays an increasing role in patient care. Healthcare providers, researchers and data scientists have teamed up to advance
machine learning
(ML) and medical diagnoses. Given the aging population and expansion of personalized gene therapies, ML models look likely to play a vital role in future healthcare provision.
Deep machine learning and medical diagnosis examples
Computer vision and ML can enhance the valuable microscope work traditionally carried out by pathologists.
Machine vision
is a common thread in diagnostic applications, which evaluate physiological data, environmental influences and genetic factors.
Thankfully, a large medical dataset is available to clinicians, ranging from symptoms to test results and image files. Detailed analysis of this resource results in a better understanding of biological mechanisms and risk factors. Next, we consider some examp...
