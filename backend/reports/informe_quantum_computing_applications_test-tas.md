Head of Quantum Systems and Principal Research Scientist, CSIRO
In recent years, the field of quantum computing has been experiencing fast growth, with
technological advances
and
large-scale investments
regularly making the news.
The United Nations has designated
2025 as the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology
.
The stakes are high ‚Äì having quantum computers would mean access to tremendous data processing power compared to what we have today. They won‚Äôt replace your normal computer, but having this kind of awesome computing power will provide advances in medicine, chemistry, materials science and other fields.
So it‚Äôs no surprise that quantum computing is rapidly becoming a global race, and private industry and governments around the world are rushing to build the world‚Äôs first full-scale quantum computer. To achieve this, first we need to have stable and scalable quantum processors, or chips.

Quantum computing‚Äôs six most important trends for 2025
The financial industry is anticipated to become one of the earliest adopters of commercially useful quantum computing technologies. These technologies are expected to become available within the next few years, making it more important than ever to follow experimental developments. Therefore, as 2024 comes to a close, we pause to reflect upon what has recently transpired and look for trends we believe will continue through 2025 and beyond. This exercise has led to the identification of six trends, each of which we cover through 2024 reports and announcements:
More experiments with logical qubits
More specialized hardware/software (as opposed to universal quantum computing)
More networking noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices together
More layers of software abs...
