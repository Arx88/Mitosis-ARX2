Machine learning (ML) powers some of the most important technologies we use,
from translation apps to autonomous vehicles. This course explains the core
concepts behind ML.
ML offers a new way to solve problems, answer complex questions, and create new
content. ML can predict the weather, estimate travel times, recommend
songs, auto-complete sentences, summarize articles, and generate
never-seen-before images.
In basic terms, ML is the process of
training
a piece of software, called a
model
, to make useful
predictions
or generate content
(like text, images, audio, or video) from
data.
For example, suppose we wanted to create an app to predict rainfall. We could
use either a traditional approach or an ML approach. Using a traditional
approach, we'd create a physics-based representation of the Earth...

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables algorithms to uncover hidden patterns within datasets. It allows them to predict new, similar data without explicit programming for each task. Machine learning finds applications in diverse fields such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, portfolio optimization, and automating tasks.
Machine learning's impact extends to autonomous vehicles, drones, and robots, enhancing their adaptability in dynamic environments. This approach marks a breakthrough where machines learn from data examples to generate accurate outcomes, closely intertwined with data mining and data science.

Machine learning
is the process of using computers to detect patterns in massive datasets and then make predictions based on what the computer learns from those patterns. This makes machine learning a specific and narrow type of
artificial intelligence
. Full artificial intelligence involves machines that can perform abilities we associate with the minds of human beings and intelligent animals, such as perceiving, learning, and problem solving.
All machine learning is based on algorithms. In general, algorithms are sets of specific instructions that a computer uses to solve problems. In machine learning, algorithms are rules for how to analyze data using statistics. Machine learning s...

Machine learning
is a branch of¬†Artificial Intelligence¬†that focuses on developing models and algorithms that let computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task. In simple words, ML teaches the systems to think and understand like humans by learning from the data.
Machine Learning is mainly divided into three core types: Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning along with two additional types, Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning.
Supervised Learning
:
Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data.
Unsupervised Learning
: Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reduction.
Reinforcement Learning
: Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal for decision-making tasks.
Note:
The following are not part of the original three core types of ML,...
