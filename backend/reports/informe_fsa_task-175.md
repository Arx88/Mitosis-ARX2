A flexible spending account (FSA) is a tax-advantaged account offered by your employer that allows you to pay for medical expenses or dependent care.
Depending on the extent of your health care or dependent care costs, an FSA can help you save a lot of money on taxes, particularly since the list of eligible expenses has expanded in recent years.

Here‚Äôs more about what FSAs are, whether you should get one and how to use one wisely.

What is a flexible spending account (FSA)?
If you have a health plan through an employer, a flexible spending account (FSA) is a tool offered by many employers as part of their overall benefits package. There are two different types of FSAs: One for health and medical expenses and one for dependent care/childcare expenses. Both FSAs were designed to help employees set aside money during the plan year to pay for out-of-pocket costs and catch a tax break in the process. Let‚Äôs go over the nuts and bolts of health care FSAs.
How do FSAs work?
An FSA is a tool that may help employees manage their health care budget. Here‚Äôs how a health and medical expense FSA works:
