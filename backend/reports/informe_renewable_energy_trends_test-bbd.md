As the U.S. accelerates its transition to clean energy, Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) companies must recognize ‚Äî and navigate ‚Äî dramatic industry shifts that can impact their solar construction business.
RenewableWorks, a TrueBlue Company that partners with EPCs and renewable energy contractors to support utility, commercial and community solar construction projects, identified these five trends for industry leaders to focus on for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025.
TREND 1
Policy support and capital influx
The renewable energy industry is riding a powerful wave of regulatory support and unprecedented investment from the U.S. government. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law in 2022 with a goal of substantially lowering the nation‚Äôs carbon emissions by 2030, allocates ne...

With 585 GW of capacity additions, renewables accounted for over 90% of total power expansion globally in 2024.
Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, 26 March 2025
‚Äì
Renewable Capacity Statistics 2025
released by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) today shows a massive increase in renewable power capacity during 2024, reaching 4 448 gigawatts (GW). The 585 GW addition last year indicates a 92.5% share of the total capacity expansion, and a record rate of annual growth (15.1%).
Although 2024 marks yet another benchmark in renewable energy capacity and growth, progress still falls short of the 11.2 terawatts needed to align with the global goal to triple installed renewable energy capacity by 2030. To reach this goal, renewable capacity must now expand by 16.6 % annually until 2030.

2024
Investment and Finance
Global new investment in renewable power and fuels (not including hydropower projects larger than 50 megawatts, MW) reached a record high of an estimated USD 622.5 billion
i
in 2023.
1
Investment increased 8.1% from 2022, due largely to the global rise in solar photovoltaic (PV) installations.
2
These estimates do not include investment in renewable heating technologies, for which data are not collected systematically. Global investment in heat pumps
ii
fell 3.7% in 2023 to USD 63.1 billion, linked in part to consumer uncertainty around government policies and subsidies as well as to falling natural gas prices.
