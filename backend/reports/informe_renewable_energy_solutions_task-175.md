This article explores the advancements and strategies in renewable energy that are shaping a sustainable energy future for 2025, focusing on key technologies, policy innovations, and the role of industry leaders.
Solar Energy Advancements
Breakthroughs in Photovoltaic Technology
As the world transitions towards sustainable energy, the development of high-efficiency solar panels has become pivotal. These advancements are driven by the need to harness more energy from sunlight, thus maximizing output while minimizing space and material usage. The latest innovations in photovoltaic (PV) technology are breaking efficiency barriers, with solar cells now converting over 25% of sunlight into electricity. This leap in efficiency is crucial for making solar power more viable and competitive with traditional energ...

By Federico Ferrario
The world is currently on to track for
a global temperature rise of 2.7˚C by the end of the century
.  That is well above the goal of 1.5
o
C set in the Paris climate agreement, and it would lead to serious changes in weather patterns worldwide.
A radical change is needed, and fast.
Making the best use of energy or – even better – using less of it is the best starting point. The next step is to make energy clean.
The scale and speed of the investment in clean energy solutions and innovations will determine whether we can still achieve a net-zero emission transition.
But what are the most promising green technology developments that can boost the decarbonisation of the economy? Let’s look at them.
The decarbonisation challenge
At a time when global energy demand is more and more pressing and fossil fuel prices continue to rise, Europe is experiencing a considerable energy squeeze. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has only highlighted the issue still further. Europe’s en...

7 Types of Renewable Energy
Read Time: 3 minutes
What is Renewable Energy?
Put simply, it’s energy production that uses non-finite resources. For instance, the Earth’s supply of coal, oil, and other fossil fuels will eventually be depleted. However, sunlight and wind, for instance, are essentially inexhaustible.
What are the Benefits of Renewable Energy?
One of the major
benefits of renewable energy
is that, while our limited resources of oil and coal get smaller every year, renewable sources of energy are more plentiful. Most inhabited places on Earth have access to at least 1 or 2 renewable energy sources, making it accessible as well. Additionally, acquiring and using renewable energy creates far less greenhouse gases and pollutants that can contribute to climate change.
Types of Renewable Energy
:
Solar
Wind Energy
Hydroelectric
Ocean
Geothermal
Biomass
Hydrogen
Why is Renewable Energy Important?
As we continue to burn through our planet’s supply of fossil fuels, it’s important to ...

Looking at the benefits of renewable energy in 2025 and beyond
Can renewable energy finally outpace coal and redefine how the world powers itself? With renewables already fueling over
30%
of global electricity in 2024, that future isn’t far off. By 2025, renewable electricity is expected to surpass coal as the world’s leading energy source, marking a turning point in the fight against climate change.
But this transformation isn’t limited to electricity grids. Green hydrogen is carving a niche in heavy industry and transport, while b...

**Contenido:**
Renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, emit little to no greenhouse gases, are readily available and in most cases cheaper than coal, oil or gas.
Renewable energy – powering a safer future
Energy
is at the heart of the climate challenge – and key to the solution.
A large chunk of the greenhouse gases that blanket the Earth and trap the sun’s heat are generated through energy production, by burning fossil fuels to generate electricity and heat.
Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas, are by far
the largest contributor to global climate change
, accounting for over 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions.
The science is clear: to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, emissions need to be reduced by almost half by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050.
To achieve this, we need to end our reliance on fossil fuels and invest in alternative sources of energy that are clean, accessible, affordable, sustainable, and reliabl...
