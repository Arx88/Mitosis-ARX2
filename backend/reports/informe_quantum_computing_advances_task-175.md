In recent years, the field of quantum computing has been experiencing fast growth, with
technological advances
and
large-scale investments
regularly making the news.
The United Nations has designated
2025 as the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology
.
The stakes are high ‚Äì having quantum computers would mean access to tremendous data processing power compared to what we have today. They won‚Äôt replace your normal computer, but having this kind of awesome computing power will provide advances in medicine, chemistry, materials science and other fields.
So it‚Äôs no surprise that quantum computing is rapidly becoming a global race, and private industry and governments around the world are rushing to build the world‚Äôs first full-scale quantum computer. To achieve this, first we need to have stable and scalable quantum processors, or chips.
