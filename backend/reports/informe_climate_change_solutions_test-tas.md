Climate actions have often fallen into one of two strategies: mitigation efforts to lower or remove greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere, and
adaptation
efforts to adjust systems and societies to withstand the impacts of climate change. The separation has led to the misinformed view that addressing climate change means pursuing
either
mitigation
or
adaptation.
This divide is counterproductive and dangerous, especially for coastal villages, farmers, small island nations and other communities at the frontlines of climate i...

Adapting to the impacts of climate change
Climate change is here. A staggering
3.6 billion people
‚Äî nearly half of the global population ‚Äî are currently highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, from droughts, floods and storms to heat stress and food insecurity. And this number will only continue to rise as long as global temperatures keep climbing.
Beyond doing everything we can to cut greenhouse gas emissions and slow the pace of global warming, we must adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change.
What can you do?
There are many ways to adapt to what is happening and what will happen. You can plant or preserve trees around your home, for instance, to keep temperatures cooler inside. Clearing brush might reduce fire hazards. If you own a business, start thinking about and planning around possible climate risks, such as hot days that prevent workers from doing outside tasks.

Our climate is changing because of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. Despite notable emission reductions over the last decades, the EU must transform production and consumption systems to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.
Overview
Key facts
EU action
Mitigating climate change means
reducing the flow of heat-trapping greenhouse gases
into the atmosphere. This involves cutting greenhouse gases from main sources such as power plants, factories, cars, and farms. Forests, oceans, and soil also absorb and store these gases, and are an important part of the solution. Reducing and avoiding our emissions requires us to reshape everything we do ‚Äî from how we power our economy and grow our food, to how we travel and live, and the products we consume. It is a problem felt
locally and globally
.
In the past decades, the
EU took firm action
against climate change, resulting in a more...

Summary
Climate change mitigation involves actions to reduce or prevent greenhouse gas emissions¬†from human activities.
Mitigation efforts include¬†transitioning to renewable energy sources, enhancing energy efficiency, adopting regenerative agricultural practices¬†and protecting and restoring forests and critical ecosystems.
Effective mitigation¬†requires a¬†whole-of-society approach and structural transformations to reduce emissions and limit global warming to 1.5¬∞C above pre-industrial levels.
International cooperation, for example through the Paris Agreement, is crucial in guiding and achieving global and national mitigation goals.
Mitigation efforts face challenges such as the world's deep-rooted dependency on fossil fuels, the increased demand for¬†new mineral resources¬†and the difficu...

What is the solution?
Switching to renewable energies,¬† solar photovoltaic and solar thermal in particular, but also wind or hydroelectricity, reduces the dependence of organisations on fossil fuels and diesel generators.¬†Organisations can choose green energy suppliers for the electricity they consume, or produce renewables themselves.
Solar energy is one of the main levers. Solar expertise could be developed in-house within aid organisations or outsourced relying on partnerships with key solar energy stakeholders.¬†Auto-production of electricity (mainly photovoltaic)¬†¬†is now facilitated by companies offering both a technical support to install solar panels and Power Purchase Agreements whereby they buy the surplus of electricity produced.
Why is it important?
Energy is at the heart of the climate challenge ‚Äì and key...

We know the world needs deep and rapid cuts in CO2 emissions to keep us on track for 1.5 degrees. The deepest cuts this decade need to happen in the world‚Äôs highest-emitting sector ‚Äì the power sector. This is because decarbonising the power sector is relatively cheap and straightforward, and because doing so opens the door to a global economy running almost entirely on clean energy.
Clean electricity will not only displace CO2 emissions from the power sector: it will also help reduce emissions from other sectors. The increasing adoption of el...

Actions to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to limit climate change
This article is about reducing greenhouse gas emissions or removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. For other topics, see
Solar radiation modification
,
Climate movement
, and
Climate change adaptation
.
Various aspects of climate change mitigation:
Renewable energy
(
solar
and
wind power
) in England, electrified
public transport in France
, a
reforestation
project in
Haiti
to
remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
, and an example of a
plant-based meal
Climate change mitigation
(or
decarbonisation
) is action to limit the
greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere that cause
climate change
. Climate change mitigation actions include
conserving energy
and
replacing fossil fuels
with
clean energy sources
. Secondary mitigation strategies include changes to land use and
removing carbon dioxide (CO
2
)
from the atmosphere.

Climate change mitigation strategies vary, and they can involve different levels of effort and scope, from broad-ranging actions taken at the government level to actions by specific industries or companies, and to behavior changes made by individuals. A successful mitigation pathway will involve combinations of these strategies.
