Technological innovation continues to shape the energy industry. As emerging technologies such as
smart grids, building automation systems, battery storage, and renewable energy
continue to grow, the electric system is becoming cleaner and more resilient. In this article, we will explore key technological energy trends, challenges with integrating new technology into the grid, and the impact on energy customers and brokers alike.
How Technology Has Affected The Energy Industry
Technology has had a great impact on the aging electrical infrastructure. From the introduction of smart meters and automation to microgrid technology, the industry is moving quickly away from analog systems. Many of these technological enhancements have allowed for new energy advancements. For example, the introduction of
smart meters and net-metering devices
has allowed for widespread adoption of behind-the-meter solar. Furthermore, at the wholesale market level,
grid operators are utilizing battery storage sys...
