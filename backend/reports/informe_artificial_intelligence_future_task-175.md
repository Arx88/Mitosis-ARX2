The future of artificial intelligence
Turing's predictions about thinking machines in the 1950s laid the philosophical groundwork for later developments in
artificial intelligence
(AI). Neural network pioneers such as Hinton and LeCun in the 80s and 2000s paved the way for generative models. In turn, the deep learning boom of the 2010s fueled major advances in
natural language processing
(NLP), image and text generation and medical diagnostics through image segmentation, expanding AI capabilities. These advancements are culminating in
multimodal AI
, which can seemingly do it all‚Äîbut just as previous advancements have led to multimodal, what might multimodal AI lead to?
Since its inception,
generative AI
(gen AI) has been evolving. Already, we have seen developers such as OpenAI and Meta move away from l...
